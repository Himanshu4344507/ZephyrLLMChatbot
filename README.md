Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:

A Hugging Face Account: You'll need this to access the platform and build your chatbot. Sign up here.
Setup and Deployment
1. Choosing Your Chatbot’s Identity
Decide what your chatbot will specialize in. It could be anything from a chef, painter, or a relaxing buddy. This will define how your chatbot interacts with users.

2. Logging into Hugging Face
Log into your Hugging Face account. If you don't have one, signing up is quick and easy.

3. Navigating to Hugging Face Spaces
Spaces are where you will create and manage your chatbot. Go to Spaces to get started.

4. Creating Your Space
Click on 'Create New Space' to start a new project. Name your Space according to your chatbot's role to make it easily identifiable.

5. Configuring Your Chatbot
Selecting the Framework and Model: Choose 'Gradio' as the framework for its user-friendly interface. Select a model like 'Zephyr 7B', which is versatile for different tasks.
Customization: Personalize your chatbot based on its role. Tailor the system messages and interaction style to match its identity.
6. Deployment
Click the create button to deploy your chatbot. This usually takes a few minutes. Once deployed, your chatbot will be ready to interact with users.

Customization Example
To make your chatbot unique, customize it extensively. For example, if you choose a 'Geek Hub' role:

Modify the system messages to include phrase like you are technical support.
Program the chatbot to suggest software or hardware related problem solutions.
Explore different roles and tweak the system instructions to discover the full potential of your chatbot. Don’t forget to share your creations and experiences, as they could inspire others.
